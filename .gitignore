#### Step 2: Undo Your Last Commit

Because you've already committed the large files locally, we need to undo that commit before you can push again.

1.  Open your terminal in VS Code.
2.  Run this command. It undoes your last commit ("Ayush was here") but **keeps all your file changes safe**:

    ```bash
    git reset --soft HEAD~1
    ```

3.  Now, "un-stage" the large data folders by running these two commands:

    ```bash
    git restore --staged data/
    git restore --staged uploads/
    ```

#### Step 3: Replace Your `backend.py`

Now, replace the entire content of your `backend.py` file with the corrected version below, which sets `num_workers` back to `0`.

This time, Git will ignore the large `data` folder, and your push will succeed. And when you run your `backend.py`, it will no longer crash during training!
